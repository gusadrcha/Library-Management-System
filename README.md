#   Library-Management-System

## Welcome to the Library Management System
---
#### In this repository you'll find our Database Project in which we have to design, create a database to handle typical things in a library. This includes, Borrowers, Books, Publishers, Current Loans, Library_Branches, Book Copies, and Book Authors. 

<br>

### This repository includes different Project Phases broken down into three parts
1. Part 1 - Create the database schema and the diagram
2. Part 2 - Create the tables in sqlite3 with necessary constraints and queries specified
3. Part 3 - Develop a frontend GUI so that the user is able to query data without the need of using sqlite3
